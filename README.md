# dotfiles

I recently cleaned all my computer's dotfiles. Starting almost from scratch. Basically bashrc and zshrc with
some aliases and basic functions. zshrc with oh-my-zsh. Some parts maybe specifics to my setup (E.g. nvidia
card).

## Pre-requisites

sudo apt install git conky links2 build-essential

## Instalation

Clone and run this

```sh
make
```

```sh
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```
